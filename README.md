AS a senior engineer working on an e-commerce platform
I WANT my platform to use Redux to manage global state instead of the Context API
SO THAT my website's state management is taken out of the React ecosystem
```

## Code Snippets

The following passage sets up the REDUX package to be used throughout the client side:

```java
import { createStore } from "redux";
import reducer from "../utils/reducers";

export default store;
```
